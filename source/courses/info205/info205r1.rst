.. _Regulate: https://www.socialtext.net/codev2/what_things_regulate

Mill's view of Liberty is that it is threatened as much by norm as by government, as much by stigma and intolerance as by the threat of state punishment.

Think about liberty in cyberspace (new regulator in cyberspace)

Regulator in different ears:

- Middle of 19th century: Norms
- Start of 20th century: State Power
- Middle of 20th century: Market
- 21st century: Code (regulator in cyberspace)

Regulation in Dot model, a dot surrounded by Market, Law, Norms, and Architecture. (Smoking example). The above four facets can also be applied to cyberspace.

Law can change each regulator, both directly and indirectly (radio theft example, seatbelt example). Indirection may cause problems (nuclear waste example)


***Thinkings: regulations such as one-child policy, taking guide dog to metro***

Modern judicial opinions usually follow a simple and predictable formula.

- Caption: title of the case. E.g. A v. B (A, B are both last names); United
States v. B,
- Case Citation: letters and numbers that tell you name of the court that
decided the case.
- The Author of the Opinion: name of the judge who wrote the opinion. "Per
Curiam" means "by the court"
- The Facts of the Case: also cover the "procedural history" of the case,
which explains how the legal dispute worked its way through the legal system
to the court that is issuing the opinion.
- The Law of the Case: two stages: discuss general principles and apply the
general legal principles to the particular facts fo the disputes.
- Concurring and/or Dissenting Opinions: A “concurring opinion” (sometimes
just called a “concurrence”) explains a vote in favor of the winning side but
 based on a different legal rationale. A “dissenting opinion” (sometimes just
  called a “dissent”) explains a vote in favor of the losing side.

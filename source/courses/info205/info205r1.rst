1. What Things Regulate_
========================
.. _Regulate: https://www.socialtext.net/codev2/what_things_regulate

Mill's view of Liberty is that it is threatened as much by norm as by government, as much by stigma and intolerance as by the threat of state punishment.

Think about liberty in cyberspace (new regulator in cyberspace)

Regulator in different ears:

- Middle of 19th century: Norms
- Start of 20th century: State Power
- Middle of 20th century: Market
- 21st century: Code (regulator in cyberspace)

Regulation in Dot model, a dot surrounded by Market, Law, Norms, and Architecture. (Smoking example). The above four facets can also be applied to cyberspace.

Law can change each regulator, both directly and indirectly (radio theft example, seatbelt example). Indirection may cause problems (nuclear waste example)


***Thinkings: regulations such as one-child policy, taking guide dog to metro***


2. Engineers and Lawyers in Privacy Protection: Can We All Just Get Along?_
===========================================================================

2.1 How Lawyers make simple things complicated
----------------------------------------------
Law student analyzes a suit by following IRAC (Issue, Rule, Analysis, Conclusion) form. Engineers seek to apply scientific analytic principles to determine the properties or state of the "system", or in a word, simplicity.

2.2 How engineers make simple things complicated.
-------------------------------------------------
Engineers always think of various scenarios and apply plenty of tests to a general requirement. For the lawyer, it is simple to say "data minimization." For the engineer, those two words are the beginning of a very complex process.

2.3 Why it may be reasonable to use the term "reasonable" in privacy rules
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Engineers can't code for "promptly" or "reasonable". Lawyers insist that rule is supposed to be neutral.

2.4 How to achieve happiness when both lawyers and engineers are in the same room
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The best results come from collaboration because of the value, knowledge, and expertise that both stakeholder groups bring to the table.

3. The IRAC Framework_
======================
.. Framework_: http://www.lawnerds.com/guide/irac.html

IRAC (Issue, Rule, Analysis, and Conclusion) forms the fundamental building blocks of legal analysis.

- ISSUE: What facts and circumstances brought these parties to court?
- RULE: What is the governing law for the issue?
- ANALYSIS: Does the rule apply to these unique facts?
- CONCLUSION: How does the court's holding modify the rule of law?

1. Coase’s Penguin, or, Linux and The Nature of the Firm
========================================================
***By Yochai Benkler***

“Coase” refers to Ronald Coase, who originated the transaction costs theory of the firm that provides the methodological template for the positive analysis of peer production that I offer here. The penguin refers to the fact that the Linux kernel development community has adopted the
image of a paunchy penguin as its mascot/trademark.

**Puzzle**

In the late 1930s, Ronald Coase wrote The Nature of the Firm,5 in which he explained why firms emerge, defining firms as clusters of resources and agents that interact through managerial command systems rather than markets. In that paper, Coase introduced the concept of transaction costs, which are costs associated with defining and enforcing property and contract rights and which are a necessary incident of organizing any activity on a market model. In open source world, programmers participate in free software projects without following the normal signals generated by market-based, firm-based, or hybrid models.

**Author's theory: Commons-based Peer Production**

I. Peer Production All Around
-----------------------------
Three main topics in this part:

* Content Production (NASA Clickworkders, World Wide Web, Wikipedia, Everything2.com, Kuroshin)
* Relevance and Accreditation Mechanisms (Amazon, Googgle, Open Directory Project, Slashdot)
* Value-Added Distribution (Napster, Gnutella,Gutenberg, Distributed Proofreaders, BtiCoin?)


II. Why Would Peer Production Emerge In A Networked Environment
---------------------------------------------------------------

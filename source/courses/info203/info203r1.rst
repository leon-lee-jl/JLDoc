1. Coase’s Penguin, or, Linux and The Nature of the Firm
========================================================
***By Yochai Benkler***

“Coase” refers to Ronald Coase, who originated the transaction costs theory of the firm that provides the methodological template for the positive analysis of peer production that I offer here. The penguin refers to the fact that the Linux kernel development community has adopted the
image of a paunchy penguin as its mascot/trademark.

**Puzzle**

In the late 1930s, Ronald Coase wrote The Nature of the Firm,5 in which he explained why firms emerge, defining firms as clusters of resources and agents that interact through managerial command systems rather than markets. In that paper, Coase introduced the concept of transaction costs, which are costs associated with defining and enforcing property and contract rights and which are a necessary incident of organizing any activity on a market model. In open source world, programmers participate in free software projects without following the normal signals generated by market-based, firm-based, or hybrid models.

**Author's theory: Commons-based Peer Production**

I. Peer Production All Around
-----------------------------
Three main topics in this part:

* Content Production (NASA Clickworkders, World Wide Web, Wikipedia, Everything2.com, Kuroshin)
* Relevance and Accreditation Mechanisms (Amazon, Googgle, Open Directory Project, Slashdot)
* Value-Added Distribution (Napster, Gnutella,Gutenberg, Distributed Proofreaders, BtiCoin?)


II. Why Would Peer Production Emerge In A Networked Environment
---------------------------------------------------------------



1. Reassessing the Social
=========================

1.1 Information Comes of Age
----------------------------

1.2 Changing Times, Enduring Optimism
-------------------------------------

Beneficial implications of information spreading via technology is is a related tendency toward what we think of as “wishing on technology,” seeing the latest technology as a shortcut to solving the social, economic, and political conundrums of the day. Example, Hyperloop Alpha, Google project Loon, Facebook Internet.org,

1.3 Two-Sided Tech
------------------
some commentators have pointed out that Google’s Loon also threatens to be as inquisitive as it is ubiquitous and, thus, a less than harmonious eye in the sky.

One of the most significant markers that more tech will not automatically eliminate social challenges lies in Silicon Valley itself.

Technology can bring good, and also bad.

1.4 Machine Learning
--------------------

1.5 Sizing Up the Social
------------------------
Enduring topics of technology: distinguishing between people and intelligent machines.

Technology can and should get rid of all the constraints to produce an ideal world, freeing the resources to solve society’s problems.

1.6 Black Arts

1.7 Legislative Code
--------------------
One of the traditional responses to problems of quasi-monopoly in any market has been government regulation.


2. The Death of Distance
========================

New Communications:

- Increased Mobility
- More Customized Content
- A Deluge of Information
- Increased Value of Brand
- More Minnows, More Giants

- Communities of Practice
- The Loose-Knot Corporation
- Openness as a Strategy
- Manufactures as Service Providers
- The Inversion of Home and Office
- The Proliferation of Ideas
- The Decline of National Authority
- Loss of Privacy
- A Global Premium for Skills
- Rebirth of Cities
- The Rise of English
- Communities of Culture
- A New Trust

1. How to Read a Paper_
=======================
.. _Paper: http://blizzard.cs.uwaterloo.ca/keshav/home/Papers/data/07/paper-reading.pdf

Three-pass method for reading research papers:

- first pass: gives you general idea about the paper
- second pass: lets you grasp the paper's content, but not its details
- third pass: helps you understand the paper in depth

**First Pass:**

- 5 to 10 minutes
- Carefully read the title, abstract, and introduction
- Read the section and sub-section headings, but ignore everything else
- Glance at the mathematical content (if any) to determine the underlying theoretical foundations
- Read the conclusions
- Glance over the references, mentally ticking o the ones you've already read

**Second Pass:**

- an hour
- note down terms you didn't understand, or questions you may want to ask the author
- Look carefully at the figures, diagrams and other illustrations in the paper. Pay special attention to graphs
- Remember to mark relevant unread references for further reading

**Third Pass:**

- many hours for beginners and more than an hour or two even for an experienced reader
- the key is to virtually re-implement the paper

**Doing A Literature Survey:**

- First, use an academic search engine such as Google Scholar or CiteSeer and some well-chosen keywords to nd three to ve recent highly-cited papers in the area.
- find shared citations and repeated author names in the bibliography (These are the key papers and researchers in that area)
- Browse websites of key researchers and find top conferences, through which you should look to find recent proceedings

2. 7 Critical Reading Strategies_
=================================
.. _Strategies: http://www.salisbury.edu/counseling/new/7_critical_reading_strategies.html

- Previewing: Learning about a text before really reading it.
- Contextualizing: Placing a text in its historical, biographical, and cultural contexts.
- Questioning to understand and remember: Asking questions about the content.
- Reflecting on challenges to your beliefs and values: Examining your personal responses.
- Outlining and summarizing: Identifying the main ideas and restating them in your own words.
- Evaluating an argument: Testing the logic of a text as well as its credibility and emotional impact.
- Comparing and contrasting related readings: Exploring likenesses and differences between texts to understand them better.


3. The Intellectual Challenge of CSCW: The Gap Between Social Requirements and Technical Feasibility_
=====================================================================================================
.. _Feasibility: http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1463020

- CSCW: Computer-Supported Cooperative Work
- In this article I argue that there is an inherent gap between the social requirements of CSCW and its technical mechanisms. The social–technical gap is the divide between what we know we must support socially and what we can support technically.

3.1 Introduction
----------------
Exploring, understanding, and hopefully ameliorating this social–technical gap is the central challenge for CSCW as a field and one of the central problems for human–computer interaction (HCI).

3.2 A Biased Summary of CSCW Findings
-------------------------------------
- the gap between human's will of sharing information and current simple access control system model
- people often lack shared histories and meanings, information must be recontextualized to reuse experience or knowledge. Systems often assume a shared understanding of information.

3.3 The Social-Technical Gap in Action
--------------------------------------

- online privacy example (Privacy Preferences Project, P3P)
- one cn easily assert that no one kows how to construct a suitable user interface for such a protocol.
- Fewer yet may take the time to categorize, because normal social activity does not require this explicit categorization.
- The preferred categories and categorization will differ form individual to individual.
- To summarize, there are no current HCI mechanisms to straightforwardly mechanize the naturally occurring, everyday social activity of handling personal information in its entirety.

**Challenge fo CSCW:**

- Systems do not allow sufficient nuance.
- Systems are not socially flexible
- Systems do not allow sufficient ambiguity

**Technical Research in CSCW:**

- some researchers emphasize a dichotomy between designers, programmers, and implementers on one hand and the social analyst on the other.
- some arguments against he significance of the gap, gap resulted merely from ignorance or habit by software designers and researchers; one could argue that the social–technical gap will be solved shortly by some new technology or software technique; one could argue that the gap is merely a historical circumstance and that we will adapt to the gap in some form

3.4 What to do?
---------------

- A future HCI challenge is to reconceptualize CSCW as a science of the artificial.

**A return to Simon: The Science of CSCW:**

- engineering and design are fundamentally different from the sciences. The key to Simon's argument is his distinction between the artificial and natural.
- In this view, engineering and design are synonymous, and new sciences are possible for understanding the nature of design.

**Palliatives: Ideological, Political, and Educational:**

- centralizing the gap leads to the logical coherence of these ideological, political, and educational initiatives.


**Beginning Systematic Exploration: First-Order Approximations:**

- First-order approximations: are tractable solutions that partially solve specific problems with known trade-offs
- CSCW already has a set of potential first-order approximations: providing systems that only partially address the social requirements, or providing CMC components such as chat within a system, Another approximation incorporates new computational mechanisms to substitute adequately for social mechanisms or to provide for new social issues; the final first-order approximation is the creation of technical architectures that do not invoke the social–technical gap;

**Toward Making CSCW Into a Science of the Artificial**

- CSCW (and perhaps HCI as well) actually has a technical spiral over time.

3.5 Conclusion
--------------
- The title of this article suggests that the social-technical gap is the fundamental problem of CSCW.
- There is a fundamental mismatch between what is required socially and what we can do technically.

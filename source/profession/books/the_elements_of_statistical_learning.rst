Chapter 1 Introducttion
=======================
To extract important patterns and trends, and understand “what the data says.” We call this learning from data. The learning problems that we consider can be roughly categorized as either supervised or unsupervised. In supervised learning, the goal is to predict the value of an outcome measure based on a number of input measures; in unsupervised learning, there is no outcome measure, and the goal is to describe the associations and patterns among a set of input measures.

Chapter 2 Overview of Supervised Learning
==========================================
* Inputs are called predictors, or independent variables, or features.
* Outputs are called responses, or dependent variables.
* **Regression:** when we predict quantitative outputs
* **classification:** when we predict qualitative outputs.

Chapter 1 Using R
=======================




Chapter 2 Data Exploration
==========================================
Data analysis always comes up with two intimate steps, exploration to find patterns in data and confirmation to verify the patterns. Two common methods for confirmation:

* Test the pattern with a new data set
* Using probability theory to test the data



Two Simple Approaches to Prediction：

* `Linear Models and Least Squares <http://baike.baidu.com/view/139822.htm>`_
* `Nearest-Neighbor Methods <http://baike.baidu.com/link?url=kCnLMhqfztQs_9EzTs8XYFlQxG0U2lqbljMghnS3GpdmXhmRZnwwj5m8nJExgk7BOuA-Gzy3KPTqHbrZBcKuaa>`_ 
  
When we talk about the number of modes that we see in our data, we’ll use the following terms: a distribution with one mode is unimodal, a distribution with two modes is bimodal, and a distribution with two or more modes is multimodal. Another important qualitative distinction can be made between data that’s symmet- ric and data that’s skewed.

Data explaration steps:
  * Inferring the types of columns in data
  * Inferring meaning
  * Exploratory data
  * Visulizing relationships between columns

Chapter 3 Classfication: Spam Filtering
=======================================
Feature generation is a major topic in current machine learning research and is still very far from being automated in a general-purpose way.
